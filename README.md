# Flutter Mask Detection App
![alt text](https://github.com/SanketMagodia/Flutter-Mask-Detection/blob/master/mask.png)

## Description


This Flutter project utilizes a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) image classification model to determine whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The app captures images from the device's camera and processes them in real-time to provide feedback on mask-wearing compliance.




## Key Features:

- Real-time mask detection using the device's camera.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for efficient inference on mobile devices.
- Provides instant feedback on whether a person is wearing a mask or not.







## Requirements
- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio / Xcode (for Android / iOS development)
- TensorFlow Lite Flutter package
- Device with a camera (for testing)
Ensure you have the required dependencies 


## Usage/Examples

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanketMagodia/Mask-Detection.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory.

``` bash
   cd flutter-mask-detection
```
### 3. Install dependencies.
``` bash
   flutter pub get
```
### 4. Run the app on a connected device or emulator

``` bash
flutter run
```





## App Usage
- Launch the app on your device.
- Grant necessary permissions for camera access if prompted.
- Point the camera towards a person's face.
- The app will analyze the captured frames and provide feedback on whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
- Ensure proper lighting conditions for accurate detection results.
